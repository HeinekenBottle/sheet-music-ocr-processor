# Sheet Music OCR Processing System Dependencies
# Core requirements for OCR.space-based sheet music digitization

# HTTP requests for OCR.space API
requests>=2.28.0

# Image processing and PDF conversion
Pillow>=9.0.0
pdf2image>=3.1.0

# PDF processing and metadata manipulation
PyPDF2>=3.0.0

# Development and testing (optional)
# pytest>=7.0.0
# black>=22.0.0
# flake8>=5.0.0

# System Requirements:
# - Python 3.8+
# - poppler-utils (for pdf2image) - see installation notes below
# - OCR.space API key (free tier available)

# Installation on macOS (2015 MacBook compatible):
# 1. Install poppler manually:
#    - Download from: https://poppler.freedesktop.org/
#    - Or use MacPorts: sudo port install poppler
#    - Or download pre-built binaries and add to PATH
# 2. pip install -r requirements.txt

# Alternative: Remove pdf2image dependency and process images directly
# (modify code to handle .tif/.png files without PDF conversion)
